# Caesar-Cipher
Encrypt and Decrypt an input text using Caesar Cipher. A simple GUI based app to encrypt  and decrypt a text using caesar cipher technique. It encrypts the text by simply shifting the letters through the alphabet with the amount given as input key. Currently, the program encrypts numbers after converting them to text values. But doesnt convert them back to numerals during decryption, So I will work on to improve this and provide other features.
The program is written using python3 and Qt5 library and Qt designer is used to generate the GUI.
PS: This is my first program using python, and i am just a beginner. Therefore, the programing might be sloppy. I will also work on improving that in the feuture to have a clean and efficient code.
